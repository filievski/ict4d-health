Wrist pain is a common complaint. Many types of wrist pain are caused by sudden injuries that result in sprains or fractures. But wrist pain also can be caused by more long-term problems such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. The precise location of your wrist pain also can give clues to what might be causing your symptoms. Not all wrist pain requires medical care. Minor sprains and strains, for instance, usually respond to ice, rest and over-the-counter pain medications. But if pain and swelling last longer than a few days or become worse, see your doctor. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to poor healing, reduced range of motion and long-term disability. As treatment, you can take medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, that may help reduce wrist pain. In case there are stronger pains, please contact the doctor.

Bleeding is the loss of blood and be caused by injuries or may be spontaneous. Bleeding may be: inside the body (internally), outside the body (externally). The symptoms are: confusion or decreasing alertness, clammy skin, dizziness, low blood pressure, paleness, rapid pulse, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, weakness. Seek medical help in the cases in which the bleeding can't be controlled, required the use of a tourniquet, or was caused by a serious injury, the wound might need stitches, gravel or dirt cannot be removed easily with gentle cleaning, you think there may be internal bleeding or shock. The most important step for external bleeding is to apply direct pressure. This will stop most external bleeding. Always wash your hands before (if possible) and after giving first aid to someone who is bleeding. This helps prevent infection. Blood loss can cause blood to collect under the skin, turning it black and blue (bruised). Apply a cool compress to the area as soon as possible to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in a towel and place the towel over the injury. Do not place ice directly on the skin.
